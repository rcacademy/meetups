# Decorator Pattern

> In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern (also known as Wrapper,
> an alternative naming shared with the Adapter pattern) is a design pattern
> that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or
> dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same
> class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single
> Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between
> classes with unique areas of concern.
