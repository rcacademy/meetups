# Observer Pattern

> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the
  subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them
  automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It
  is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. The Observer
  pattern is also a key part in the familiar model–view–controller (MVC)
  architectural pattern.[1] The observer pattern is implemented in numerous
  programming libraries and systems, including almost all GUI toolkits.
