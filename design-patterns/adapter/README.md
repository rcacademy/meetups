# Adapter Pattern

> An adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the
> real world definition for an adapter. The adapter design pattern is used when
> you want two different classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
> Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the
> need. The Adapter pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work
> together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected
> by the clients.
