# Composite Pattern

> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design
> pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be
> treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a
> composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
> hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual
> objects and compositions uniformly.
